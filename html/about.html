            <p>
            Hey I'm Revekka, a final year student of Informatics and Telecommunications at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a solid foundation in C and C++, with additional experience in Python and Java. 
                I pursued an internship focused on Backend Development, where I expanded my Java skills and gained new knowledge of tools and technologies such as SQL, Spring Boot, and Docker. 
                I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I have used to create personal projects and enhance my web development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about technology and programming and always eager to learn new things. 
                I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to grow as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently focusing on improving my skills in Frontend Development as I am interested in becoming a Full Stack Developer.
                I am also interested in exploring the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning, as I believe they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology.
