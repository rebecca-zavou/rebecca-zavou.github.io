                        <p> The course focused on database design and learning how to interact with them. The first two assignments involved implementing Static and Extendible Hashing.
                            Both assignments were completed in groups, with each group responsible for implementing all the necessary structs.
                            Given a dataset of people and their personal information, we were tasked with developing functions to read the data, hash it into the hash table, rehash as needed, and save the results to an output file.
